# Isolated Network Log Analyser
## Background
Continuous monitoring of systems and network is extremely essential to detect, prevent, and respond to the cyber security threats. Security operation centre (SOC) plays an important role for situational awareness of an organisation, where all logs are monitored continuously. This provides a near real-time perception of threat landscape. However, in case of a scenario where multiple isolated networks are to be monitored, it may be important to undertake this activity in all isolated networks independently. The central monitoring may also be taken up separately, only the logs are collected in the central location on regular intervals.
